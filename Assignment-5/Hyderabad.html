<p>Hyderabad was founded in 1591 and planned as a grid with the Charminar at its centre. It has now grown well beyond the confines of the original walled city,to include a new town north of the Musi river, the Military Cantonment at Secunderabad and a burgeoning high-tech Estate, nicknamed “Cyberabad”.</p>

<p>Hyderabad is famous for its rich history as the seat of the Nizams, its iconic landmarks like the Charminar and Golconda Fort, its unique blend of North and South Indian culture, its world-renowned biryani and pearl trade, and its booming modern IT sector, earning it nicknames like "City of Pearls" and "Cyberabad"</p>
